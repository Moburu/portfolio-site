TODO:
- Make landing section larger on very small screens (especially the social links)
- Make overlay fade out nicely on closing hamburger menu
- Fix projects at very small screen sizes (~400px wide)
- Add on-click button animations for Contact sections
- Remove all placeholder text/images
- Write up an actual readme
- Navbar onhover animation
- Section dividers?
- Maybe give the express icon a different on-hover color (or none)
- Add picture to About section

Lessons learned:
- Consolidate styles more, things got out of hand way too quickly
- Modularize
- Figure out what was wrong with the content overflowing the page, why I had to put stuff like "width: calc(100% - 20px)" all over
