TODO:
- Remove all placeholder text/images
- Write up an actual readme
- Make links navigate to correct height on page


Lessons learned:
- Consolidate styles more, things got out of hand way too quickly
- Modularize
- Figure out what was wrong with the content overflowing the page, why I had to put stuff like "width: calc(100% - 20px)" all over
- Pay more attention to the cascading part of CSS (i.e. writing a style for "h1" in one component will affect every h1 on the page)
